mfbl-giant;24;2;2;2;1;24;2-6-Improvised armor;;**Weapon** A Giant typically swings a large club or a tree. If the Giant loses its weapon, the Weapon Damage of its attacks is decreased to 1. Giants never `PARRY` attacks.\n**Weak spot** Attacks against the weak spot on the top of a Giant’s head inflict double damage. Hitting the top of the head requires either a difficult (–2) ranged attack from an elevated position or for the attacker to first climb onto the Giant. The latter move counts as a `GRAPPLE` attack. No other effects of the `GRAPPLE` apply in such a case.;fbl;atk-giant
