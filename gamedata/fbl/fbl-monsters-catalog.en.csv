mfbl-abyss-worm-old;18;2;;;2;18;10;;**Weak Mouth Cavity** Attack vs. mouth is -2 but ignores armor.;fbl;atk-abyss-worm
mfbl-bloodling;8;4;;;1;8;6;;**Incorporial Form** As mist immune to physical damage, otherwise damage halfed (rounded up) except copper weapons.\n**Sensitive to light** They loathe light, a torch or lantern (blunt instrument) inflicts +D3 damage.;fbl;atk-bloodling
mfbl-death-knight;12;3;3;2;;12;0;Scout 2;**Armor Rating** none, except worn armor. Takes half damage from physical attacks (rounded up).\n**Typical Gear** Longsword, chainmail.;fbl;atk-death-knight

mfbl-dragon-large;48;4;6;3;3;48;12;Scout 3|Lore 3|Insight 4|Manipulation 3;Adventurers `SCOUT` success can spot a gap in scales, an attack has -3 but ignores half the AR on a hit.;fbl;atk-dragon
mfbl-drakewyrm;25;3;5;2;2;25;8;Scout 3;**Drawn to glitter** If the Drakewyrm spots anyone wearing or holding anything that glitters, it will immediately attack that person. If this person leaves combat, the Drakewyrm will pursue.;fbl;atk-drakewyrm
mfbl-ent;16;3;5;3;1;16;6;;**Sensitive to fire** All attacks using fire cause double damage.;fbl;atk-ent
mfbl-ghost;8;3;3;2;1;8;0;;**Armor Rating** Ghosts are immaterial and can only be hurt by fire or magic. Even if a ghost is defeated, it will only be banished for a Quarter Day and will then return. The only way to truly destroy a ghost is to use the `PURGE UNDEAD` spell on it.;fbl;atk-ghost
mfbl-giant;24;2;2;2;1;24;2-6-Improvised armor;;**Weapon** A Giant typically swings a large club or a tree. If the Giant loses its weapon, the Weapon Damage of its attacks is decreased to 1. Giants never `PARRY` attacks.\n**Weak spot** Attacks against the weak spot on the top of a Giant’s head inflict double damage. Hitting the top of the head requires either a difficult (–2) ranged attack from an elevated position or for the attacker to first climb onto the Giant. The latter move counts as a `GRAPPLE` attack. No other effects of the `GRAPPLE` apply in such a case.;fbl;atk-giant
mfbl-giant-squid;14;4;;;1;14;4;;**Sensitive Head** `BLUNT` weapons ignore armor if they hit the creature’s head. Attacking the head is a difficult (–2) action.\n**Tentacles** The giant squid has D6+3 tentacles. In each round the squid attacks using up to D3 tentacles. This counts as a single slow action. Each tentacle performs an attack from the monster attack table. For every three points of damage suffered, the squid loses one tentacle.;fbl;atk-giant-squid
mfbl-gray-bear;14;2;;;2;14;4;Scout 3;**Feral Rage** When the Strength of a Gray Bear is halved, it is overcome by a deadly rage and will attack anything close by, letting out a deafening roar. All  Targets within `ARM’S LENGTH` each suffer an attack with __**seven** Base Dice with a Weapon Damage of **1** (slash wound)__. This attack is triggered immediately and does not count toward the bear’s actions during the round.;fbl;atk-gray-bear

mfbl-harpies;8-16;3;2;1;2;8;;Scout 2|Insight 4|Manipulation 2;**Flock** Harpies never fight on their own, always attacking in flocks, and a flock of harpies counts as a single monster. The Strength of the flock varies, depending on the number of individuals. A single attack against a flock of harpies can never inflict more than 1 point of damage.\n**Cowardly** Harpies are cowardly creatures and never fight until death. When the Strength of the flock has been halved, the harpies automatically `FLEE` from the fight (see page 89 in the Players’ Handbook). They may return at a later time.;fbl;atk-harpies
mfbl-hydra;4;4;;;2;4;5;;**The Hydra's Heads** The Hydra has D3+3 heads, each with its own `STRENGTH` rating. The Hydra has as many attacks as it has heads, so draw one initiative card for each head. A head whose `STRENGTH` reaches zero is crushed or severed. Two new heads grow in its place in the next round, unless the severed head is seared by fire. This requires a torch or something similar and a `MOVE` roll (slow action).;fbl;atk-hydra
mfbl-insectoids-workers-drones;5;3;;;1;5;4;;**Monster attacks** The rules for monsters in combat don’t apply to Insectoids. Instead, they act like normal fighters. As they lack Wits and Empathy, however, they are immune to spells that damage these attributes, as well as to the `MANIPULATION` skill.;fbl;{bite:0:1:0:Slash wound:1}
mfbl-insectoids-soldiers;7;4;;;2;7;4;;**Monster attacks** The rules for monsters in combat don’t apply to Insectoids. Instead, they act like normal fighters. As they lack Wits and Empathy, however, they are immune to spells that damage these attributes, as well as to the `MANIPULATION` skill.;fbl;{bite:0:2:0:Slash wound, paralyzing poison with **Potency 7**:1}
mfbl-insectoids-queen;14;3;;;1;14;6;;**Monster attacks** The rules for monsters in combat don’t apply to Insectoids. Instead, they act like normal fighters. As they lack Wits and Empathy, however, they are immune to spells that damage these attributes, as well as to the `MANIPULATION` skill.;fbl;{bite:0:2:0:Slash wound, lethal poison with **Potency 8**:1}
mfbl-manticore;14;4;;;2;14;5;Scout 4;**Sensitive Tail**: A `BLUNT` weapon hit on the tip of a Manticore’s tail (–3 to hit) that causes three points of damage or more will crush its poison glands, inflicting one point of damage to Agility per round of combat.;fbl;atk-manticore
mfbl-minotaur;10;4;2;2;1;10;2;Scout 3;**Armor** Additional armor bonus possible, if worn.\n**Typical Gear** Two-handed axe.;fbl;atk-minotaur
